**Description**

This repo contains 2 datsets: MotionData.csv and MotionDataAveraged.csv

The two datsets were generated by the script run_analysis.R.

See CodeBook.md for more information on the dataset.

The processing steps were

1. Download the origional .zip file
2. Read the activity labels
3. Read the feature descriptions; get indicies of features containing 'mean' and 'standard deviation'
4. Read the test data files. There were 3 files; one containing the subject id for each observation,
one containing te activity id for each observation, and the final file contained the feature vector for each observation. Only features corresponding to the 'mean' and 'standard deviation' were retained.
5. Read the training data files. The process was the same as that for the test data files.
6. Combine the test and training data into one dataset, "MotionData.csv"
7. Compute the average of each feature vector across all observation windows for each subject and activity. The result is the dataset "MotionDataAveraged.csv"
